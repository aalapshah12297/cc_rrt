# Keeping the inflation radius high ensures that we can get the 'distance to
# nearest obstacle' from the cost upto a reasonable range (2.4m from robot).
# Based on calculations (keeping the source code in mind), these values will
# give a final cost change of ~2 per cell. Actually, these values are
# overriden by the values from rqt_reconfigure, so it is better to change the
# default values in InflationPlugin.cfg rather than modifying them here (which
# will essentially have no effect).
